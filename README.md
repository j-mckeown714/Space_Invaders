# Space_Invaders
Space Invaders made with python

This project was my first attempt at making a game using python/ pygame.
It took two days to develop this game.

The most challenging aspect of this project was writting the lazers (including the lazer cooldown 
and removing the enemy ships when they were hit and removing health from the players ship. 

Firsty, I loaded the images I would need for this program (ships, background, lazers etc). 
Then I moved onto making the class for the ships. Moving on, I wrote the code for the ships movement.
After the movement I started writting the code for the lazers. I implemented the code for the enemey ships to spawn in different locations above the screen. Then I wrote the health bar, lives code and main manu.
